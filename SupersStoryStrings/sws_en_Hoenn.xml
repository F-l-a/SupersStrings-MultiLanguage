If a move worked successfully, the Skill rating goes up.\nIf a move failed, the Skill rating is lowered. If it was an offensive\nmove, the Skill rating goes up if the move was «super effective»\nand goes down if it was «not very effective.» The Skill rating will\nnot go up for moves such as PROTECT and DETECT.

                    <string id="270889474">The third judging factor is «Body.»\nThis factor is based on how much HP remained at the end of a\nbattle. The rating takes into account how much HP a POKéMON\nhad at the start of battle, and what remained at the end.</string>

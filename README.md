# Information
**Q: What is SupersStrings?**
> SupersStrings is my passion project for the PokeMMO community to achieve the goal of unlocking the full potential of what strings can offer.
> After strings were nerfed, a lot of people saw strings as useless or borderline do nothing.
> I'm here to give my take on strings to change that perspective that strings are more than just making text faster, and going above and beyond what they can offer.
> In SupersStrings, you can expect the normal faster text boxes but with QOL, additional information, and new guiding features.

**Q: Which version should I choose?**
> There are two versions of SupersStrings.
> The first version, SupersStoryStrings, has NPC dialogue text compressed into as few dialogue boxes as possible, increasing the speed of text in-game without a trade-off for readability.
> The second version, SupersSpeedStrings, has almost all NPC text removed for those that prefer the "old strings" feel of the blank textboxes.

> [!TIP]
> There is *virtually* no difference in the performance between the two versions of the strings, ultimately choose whichever suits your preferences.
